# 🚀 Space Defender — HTML5 Canvas Game

**Space Defender** is a fast-paced, browser-based arcade shooter built with **vanilla JavaScript** and **HTML5 Canvas**. The player controls a futuristic spaceship, defends space from incoming enemies, and progresses through increasingly difficult levels.

This project was designed and implemented by **Deividas Strole**, Full-Stack Developer, as a demonstration of clean JavaScript game logic, animation loops, collision detection, and interactive UI rendering without external libraries.
